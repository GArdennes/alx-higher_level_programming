### Tasks
0. Rectangle #0
Write an empty class "Rectangle" that defines a rectangle:
Requirement
You must use the class notation for defining your class

1. Rectangle #1
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle. The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h. Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w. Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h.
Requirement
You must use the class notation for defining your class

2. Rectangle #2
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle. The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h. Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w. Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h. If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object. 
Requirement
You must use the class notation for defining your class

3. Rectangle #3
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle. The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h. Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w. Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h. If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object. Create an instance method called print that prints the rectangle using the character X.
Requirement
You must use the class notation for defining your class

4. Rectangle #4
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle. The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h. Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w. Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h. If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object. Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X. Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle. Create an instance method called double() that multiplies the width and the height of the rectangle by 2.

5. Square #0
Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js. The constructor must take 1 argument: size. The constructor of Rectangle must be called(by using super()).
Requirement
You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends.

6. Square #1
Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js. Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c. If c is undefined, use the character X.
Requirement
You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends

7. Occurrences
Write a function "exports.nbOccurences = function (list, searchElement)" that returns the number of occurrences in a list.

8. Esrever
Write a function "exports.esrever = function (list)" that returns the reversed version of a list.
Requirement
You are not allowed to used the built-in method "reverse"

9. Log me
Write a function "exports.logMe = function (item)" that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value. The output format: <number arguments already printed>: <current argument value>.

10. Number conversion
Write a function "exports.converter = function (base)" that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument.
Requirement
You are not allowed to import any file.
You are not allowed to declare any new variable (var, let, etc)
